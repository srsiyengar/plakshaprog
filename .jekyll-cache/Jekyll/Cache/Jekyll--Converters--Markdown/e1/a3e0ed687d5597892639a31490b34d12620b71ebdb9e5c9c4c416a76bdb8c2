<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>This course is a hands on introduction to programming with emphasis on confidence building than syllabus coverage. The topics listed in the <a href="/plaksha/syllabus/">Syllabus</a> section is more of a checklist and and does not enumerate the topics that will be covered.</p>

<p>We will have a problem centric approach to the subject. We will first ask a question for which a skill turns out to be an answer. The <a href="/plaksha/roadmap/">roadmap</a> section is a link worth bookmarking. You should be refering to it for your independent study, apart from solving questions from the <a href="/plaksha/questionverse/">Questionverse</a></p>

<h1 id="expectations-from-the-course">Expectations from the course</h1>
<p>By the end of the course, you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write a piece of code with confidence.</li>
  <li>You will understand the importance of modular programming and you will realise its importance in projects which are large in size.</li>
  <li>You will know the importance of programming in data sciences.</li>
  <li>You will know the basics of big data crunching.</li>
  <li>You will be able to write several lines of code with ease.</li>
  <li>Through some programming exercises, you will understand and appreciate the interplay between math &amp; computing.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<h2 id="performance-points">Performance Points</h2>

<p>There will be performance points assigned to every student using the following rule:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Â </th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Â </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Attendance in classes/labs</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">2 per hour</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Late for the class/lab (irrespective of the urgency)</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">-10 per class/lab</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Plagiarism/Cheating/Misconduct</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">PP will drop to 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Challenge Assignment</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">X</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>If a student misses a lab or class, his/her \(PP\) will be uniformly distributed to the rest of the class who were present. For example in a class of 30, if 10 people are absent for a lab session, 40 \(PP\) will be distributed to the remaining 20 students. Each student will get \(\frac{40}{20}=2\).</li>
  <li>A student coming late for the class, loses 10 $PP$ and this will be uniformly distributed to all those present in the class.</li>
  <li>X denotes that it is discretionary. The instructor can provide challenge assignments from time to time which will add in extra <em>PP</em> s to your credit.</li>
  <li>Plagiarism/Cheating/Misconduct will result in the reset of the performance points. It will roll back to 0. The only way we will figure out plagiarism is through viva voce.</li>
  <li>The deficit \(PP\)s will be assigned by the instructor based on his discretion, evaluated based on sincerity and overall conduct.</li>
  <li>This will be in practice starting from September 1st 2022.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evaluation-and-grades">Evaluation and Grades</h2>

<p>Final grades will be calculated based on the following rule:
\(\left(\frac{PP}{100}.Total\right)+\left( \frac{PP}{8}\right)\)</p>

<p>Where <em>PP</em> stands for <em>Performance Points</em> and <em>Total</em> is the marks secured from theory, lab and project components.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>

<h2 id="theory-assignments">Theory Assignments</h2>
<p>Theory assignments will involve writeups that are mostly straight forward and will be indicative of the difficulty in the mid term and final exams. Questions for the final exam will be consequential concepts from the assignments. It would help if assignments are taken seriously for the student to secure good marks in the exams.</p>

<h2 id="lab-assignments">Lab Assignments</h2>
<p>Lab assignments will involve you to work on programming based questions. These can be take home tests or in lab tests. The difficulty level is indicative of the final lab exam questions. The evaluation of lab assignments will involve a strong viva voce component.</p>

<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>The student will be asked to pick a project from a list of topics. The projects will mostly be explorative in nature. Every project will be executed by a team of at most 2 people. Evaluation of the project will be based on the report and presentation.</p>
