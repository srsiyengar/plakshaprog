@TAs

Note: Leave it to me if you cannot cover some of the topics. 

1. Session on basic probability (absolute minimals).
2. Session on functions. How to find minima/maxima of a function. 
3. Session on Geogebra.
4. Teach them: 
	- Matrix multiplication.
	- Determinants.
	- Geometrical meaning of dot product.
	- Matrix Inverse.
	- Finding Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors.
	(All of these should be for 2x2 matrices only).
