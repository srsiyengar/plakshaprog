@Anamika 

You can take a look at the Questionverse and teach them something non-trivial. Most of them are good at programming and may not require any syntax level instrucitons. You can do the following:

1. Give them a short ungraded quiz online and check their background. 
2. Show them a couple of programming illustrations based on the questions asked in the questionverse.
3. You can also feel free to teach them anything you think is important for someone who has intermediate programming skillset. 

As you can notice from the [hanbook](/plakshaprog/handbook/), 10 marks is for theory internals and 10 for lab internals. You can evaluate their assignments by asking them to upload them on brightspace. The assignments are earmarked in the [questionverse](/plakshaprog/questionverse). Feel free to give your own assignments.
