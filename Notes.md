# Getting familiarized with Python

Note that Python is simpler than you would expect. Once you get to know of the basic syntax, you can start writing complicated code. Understand the following to begin with: 
- How to assign a value to a variable.
- How to handle a list (only the basics).
- How to use a for loop.
- It is fun to use random function. Try simulating a coin toss.
