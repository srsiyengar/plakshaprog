<p>You can take a look at the Questionverse and teach them something non-trivial. Most of them are good at programming and may not require any syntax level instrucitons. You can do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Give them a short ungraded quiz online and check their background.</li>
  <li>Show them a couple of programming illustrations based on the questions asked in the questionverse.</li>
  <li>You can also feel free to teach them anything you think is important for someone who has intermediate programming skillset.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can notice from the <a href="/plakshaprog/handbook/">hanbook</a>, 10 marks is for theory internals and 10 for lab internals. You can evaluate their assignments by asking them to upload them on brightspace. The assignments are earmarked in the <a href="/plakshaprog/questionverse">questionverse</a>. Feel free to give your own assignments.</p>

<p>Regards, <br />
