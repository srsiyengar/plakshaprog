# Chapter 1: Warming up with Basics 
1. Use the python `print` command and figure out ways in which you can display things on the terminal. 
2. Print the following using four print statements: 
```
*
**
***
****
```
3. Figure out how to input a number and display it using print statement.
4. Understand how to use a ```if loop``` in python. Ask the user to enter a number and check if the number is even or odd.
5. Print a sequence of numbers starting from the number **a** with common difference **d**. Go on till you reach the number **b**.   
```
Enter a value for a: 10
Enter a value for d: 3
Enter a value for b: 20
Output: 10 13 16 19
```


6. Enter a number and check if it is prime or not. 
7. Input integers `i` and `j` and create a list comprising of all prime numbers between them. 

8. Observe the following code :
* What does the following code do:
```python
print("Enter a number")
k=input()
k=int(k)
for i in range(k):
		for j in range(i):
		print("*",end=' ')
print("")
```
* Something is wrong in this code. Fix it!

9. Write a script to print the following: 
```
Input a number: 5
Output: 
       *
      ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

10. Write a script to print the following zig zag:
```
*
  *
    *
      *
    *
  *
*
  *
    *
      *
    *
  *
*
```

```
<pre>

  *
   *
    *
	</pre>
```

Input parameters: `number of lines`, `inclination`, `number of stars per stick`  
Note: Input parameters are _self-explanatory_, `inclination` is a value between `0` and `1`. Lesser the inclination, more vertical the stick. 

#### **Assignment:** Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA_70M-ma-k) and write a piece of code to solve this problem.  

# Chapter 2 : Lists 

1. Create a list *L* of integers between *i* and *j*. 
2. Create a list *L* of prime numbers between *i* and *j*.
3. Create a list of lists. Eg: 
```
L=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
```
